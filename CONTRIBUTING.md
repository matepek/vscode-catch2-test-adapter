## Contributing to the source

- Report a bug ("properly").
- Tell me about your desired features.
- Create a pull request (against the development branch or master (if you sure your your PR is ready to be deployed)).
- Documentation related improvements (ex.:typos) are only accepted as issues, not as PRs.

### Clone Repo

It is recommended to create a push hook:

`cp ./resources/githooks/pre-push ./.git/hooks/pre-push`

Content of **.git/hooks/pre-push** file:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "pre-push hook:"
set -e -x
npm audit --production
npm run compile
npx mocha ./out/test/Documentation.test.js ./out/test/ESLint.test.js
```

### Install

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

### Test

> Since the big refactoring I had no time to adjust the tests :(

After installing:

```bash
npm test
```

### Debug

After test:

1. Open the folder in VSCode: `code .`.
2. Let task `npm watch` run in the background.
3. VSCode "Run" / Debug page: Select `Manual cpp`.
4. Start debugging.
5. Add your folder to the newly opened VSCode's workspace. (Or change [launch.json](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter/blob/master/.vscode/launch.json)'s `Manual cpp` to the folder which is intended to be debugged and the start.)

Issues are tipically related to file operations:

- [ExecutableFactory.ts](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter/blob/master/src/framework/ExecutableFactory.ts)
- [GoogleTestExecutable.ts](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter/blob/master/src/framework/GoogleTest/GoogleTestExecutable.ts)
- [Catch2Executable.ts](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter/blob/master/src/framework/Catch2/Catch2Executable.ts)

#### Compiling C++ tests

```sh
mkdir test/cpp/build
cd test/cpp/build
cmake -G Ninja .. # or just cmake ..
```

### Publishing to market

If you think your changes worth of a release add a new version entry to `CHANGELOG.md` file without a date. CI will publish it automatically.

## VSCODE TESTING API

### TODOs

- 1. run skipped directly; 2. run skipped by parent; see status: not resetted, shouldn't be
- 2. security concern note
